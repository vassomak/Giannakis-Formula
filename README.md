# Giannakis-Formula
This is an assignment of the course Advanced Signal Processing (AUTh-7th semester-2020)


At the first part of the assignment (questions 1-6) the aim is to construct a MA-q system (for q=5) with known input and output, in order to check the validity of Giannakis' formula.

Initially, a real sicrete signal x[k] is constructed, with k=1,2, ...,N=2048, which is derived as the output of a MA-q process with coefficients of [1, 0.93, 0.85, 0.72, 0.59, -0.1], driven by non-Gaussian noise v[k], which is derived from an exponential distribution with mean value of 1.
